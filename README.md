### What is Alphix?

Alphix is a next-generation decentralized exchange (DEX) built on top of [<mark style="color:$primary;">**Uniswap V4**</mark>](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/overview). Our mission is to become the leading platform for hook-driven innovation by serving as a composable layer that accelerates experimentation and unlocks efficient primitives for the ecosystem.&#x20;

Alphix pools are customizable and seamlessly composable. Activity is concentrated into a single, deep and capital-efficient venue that evolve with market conditions — fixing the proliferation of competing pools that fragment liquidity, leave capital idle, and enforce static fees.

### Products

LPs earn higher risk-adjusted returns without position management.</td><td><a href=".gitbook/assets/DY-(card).jpg">DY-(card).jpg</a></td><td><a href="products/dynamic-fee.md">dynamic-fee.md</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Unified Yield</strong></td><td>Idle liquidity is lent out on lending markets when not needed for swaps. Unified Pools generate passive returns from two yield sources.</td><td><a href=".gitbook/assets/UY-(card).jpg">UY-(card).jpg</a></td><td><a href="products/unified-yield.md">unified-yield.md</a></td></tr></tbody></table>
