# Alphix Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
These docs are a work in progress, actively evolving alongside the protocol.
{% endhint %}

Alphix is a next-generation decentralized exchange (DEX) built on top of [<mark style="color:$primary;">**Uniswap V4**</mark>](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/overview). Our mission is to become the leading platform for Hook-driven innovation by serving as a flexible layer where new products and market mechanisms can be added seamlessly without fragmenting liquidity or breaking composability.

We design hooks that are flexible, customizable, and modular. This creates a single deep liquidity venue for liquidity providers, traders, and developers that evolves with market needs, instead of spawning multiple competing pools or one-off contracts.

Alphix supports and accelerates the next wave of AMM innovation, combining the efficiency and security of Uniswap v4 with a flexible hook framework that unifies liquidity and fixes the flexibility issues of Hook architecture.
