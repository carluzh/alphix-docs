# Introduction

Welcome to the Alphix documentation. This guide covers the core concepts, architecture, and usage of the protocol.

### What is Alphix?

Alphix is a next-generation decentralized exchange (DEX) built on top of [<mark style="color:$primary;">**Uniswap V4**</mark>](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/overview). Our mission is to become the leading platform for Hook-driven innovation by serving as a flexible layer where new products and market mechanisms can be added seamlessly without fragmenting liquidity or breaking composability.

We design hooks that are flexible, customizable, and modular. This creates a single deep liquidity venue for liquidity providers, traders, and developers that evolves with market needs, instead of spawning multiple competing pools or one-off contracts.

### Products

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards">
<thead><tr><th></th><th></th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><strong>Dynamic Fees</strong></td><td>Swap fees adjust based on market volatility and pool type. LPs earn higher risk-adjusted returns without managing multiple positions.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Unified Yield</strong></td><td>Idle liquidity is deployed to Aave, earning yield even when not actively used in swaps. Positions generate passive returns automatically.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Points

Early users earn Points for every swap and LP action. Points accumulate across seasons and will matter. Track your progress at [alphix.fi/points](https://alphix.fi/points).

### Audits and Security
