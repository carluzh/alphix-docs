### What is Alphix?

Alphix is a next-generation decentralized exchange (DEX) built on top of [<mark style="color:$primary;">**Uniswap V4**</mark>](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/overview). Our mission is to become the leading platform for Hook-driven innovation by serving as a flexible layer where new products and market mechanisms can be added seamlessly without fragmenting liquidity or breaking composability.

We design hooks that are flexible, customizable, and modular. This creates a single deep liquidity venue for liquidity providers, traders, and developers that evolves with market needs, instead of spawning multiple competing pools or one-off contracts.

### Products

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th data-hidden data-card-cover data-type="files"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Dynamic Fees</strong></td><td>Swap fees adjust based on market volatility and pool type. LPs earn higher risk-adjusted returns without managing multiple positions.</td><td><a href=".gitbook/assets/DY-(card).jpg">DY-(card).jpg</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Unified Yield</strong></td><td>Idle liquidity is deployed to Aave, earning yield even when not actively used in swaps. Positions generate passive returns automatically.</td><td><a href=".gitbook/assets/UY-(card).jpg">UY-(card).jpg</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Points

Alphix rewards early users with Points. Earn through swapping, providing liquidity, and referrals. Points accumulate across seasons — 100,000 distributed weekly based on your share of protocol activity.
