# Alphix Partners

Alphix is more than a next-generation DEX — it’s a composable platform designed for collaboration. We empower projects, protocols, and institutions to build unique liquidity experiences, access advanced yield strategies, and offer their users cutting-edge DeFi functionality — all while leveraging the security, efficiency, and flexibility of our Unified Pools.<br>

### **Why Partner with Alphix?**



* **Composable & Customizable Pools**\
  Create a pool tailored to your project or community. Set custom fees, hooks, and liquidity parameters while benefiting from Alphix’s capital-efficient, unified liquidity infrastructure.
* **Seamless Integration of Yield Sources**\
  Leverage your own yield sources — lending protocols, vaults, or external incentives — and combine them with Alphix’s Unified Yield framework to offer dual rewards to users: swap fees **and** yield from your source.
* **Boost Engagement & Loyalty**\
  Reward your users with protocol points, staking incentives, or ecosystem-specific benefits, all fully integrated within Alphix’s composable architecture.
* **Security & Reliability**\
  Partners benefit from Alphix’s continuous security posture: audits, AI-assisted analysis (Sherlock AI, Olympix), fail-safes, and upcoming bug bounty programs ensure your pools are robust and trustworthy.
* **Flexible Collaboration Models**\
  Whether you want a branded pool for your community, a yield-integrated strategy, or co-marketing initiatives, Alphix works with you to design a solution that maximizes impact while minimizing friction.

### **Get Involved**

Alphix is actively seeking forward-thinking partners who want to push the boundaries of DeFi. Whether you’re a protocol looking to offer enhanced liquidity experiences, a project with an ERC-4626 compliant yield strategy, or a community to engage, we want to collaborate.

**Let’s build something extraordinary together.**
