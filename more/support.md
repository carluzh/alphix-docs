#### Frequently Asked Questions

**How is Alphix different from Uniswap or other AMMs?**

> Alphix is built directly on Uniswap V4’s new Hooks framework but takes it further. Instead of launching multiple isolated pools and fee tiers, Alphix consolidates liquidity into unified pools with built-in features like dynamic fees. This reduces fragmentation, deepens liquidity, and gives LPs and traders better execution with less complexity.

**What are Hooks and why do they matter?**

> Hooks are modular smart contracts introduced in Uniswap V4 and adopted by several other top DEXs like Balancer and Pancake Swap. They can run extra logic at key points in a pool's lifecycle (swaps, liquidity changes, etc.). Alphix uses Hooks to embed advanced features — like Dynamic Fees, Unified Yield, or Internalizing MEV — directly into a single pool. This makes Alphix more flexible and feature-rich than traditional AMMs.

**How does Alphix keep my funds safe?**

> Alphix builds on top of **well-established protocols** like Uniswap V4 and uses **battle-tested standards** such as OpenZeppelin. All Hooks include built-in safety checks, and major releases follow a clear **audit roadmap** with reputable third-party firms. While no smart contract can be risk-free, Alphix is designed from the ground up with security and transparency in mind.

**On which networks is Alphix deployed?**

> Alphix is currently live on <mark style="color:$info;">**Base Mainnet.**</mark> All our contracts are verified and audited. We are exploring an expansion to Unichain in the future.

**Why Base?**

> By launching on Base, Alphix can:
>
> * Test and iterate quickly thanks to low fees and high throughput.
> * Provide LPs and traders with a smooth UX without gas becoming a barrier.
> * Integrate easily with other Base-native projects and liquidity sources.
> * Position itself in one of the fastest-growing L2 ecosystems.
>
> Once Alphix has completed audits and proved the competitiveness of its hook, we will be ready to scale beyond Base. We have our eyes on Unichain to support our core but we are open to suggestions!
