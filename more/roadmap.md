#### Long-Term Vision

The DeFi landscape evolves rapidly, making long-term predictions challenging. Our north star is **Unified Pools** - single pools with unified liquidity that deliver best-in-class features for all participants.

We'll achieve this vision through continuous innovation, market-driven insights, and strategic partnerships that push the boundaries of what's possible in decentralised finance.
