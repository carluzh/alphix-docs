# Roadmap

### 2026 Q1

**Points System**

<mark style="color:$info;">To recognise early adopters and active community members, we will create a unique Points Campaign. While concrete mechanics remain secret, this system will be central to our early growth strategy.</mark>

**Protocol Integrations**

<mark style="color:$info;">DEX Aggregators are a core part of our approach to solving the bootstrapping question through our Dynamic Fee feature. We have already seen strong interest expressed by both leading aggregators as well as other potential partner protocols, with a growing demand for customizable pool infrastructure. We will continue working with them, possibly co-developing valuable features.</mark>

<mark style="color:$info;">**Pre-Seed**</mark>

<mark style="color:$info;">After having proven product-market-fit with a successful launch we will attempt to raise an early round to guarantee funding for ongoing development costs. This is necessary as our monetization comes through our first feature addition which was part of our strong GTM strategy.</mark>



### 2026 Q2

**Rehypothecation**

<mark style="color:$info;">The launch of our second feature on top of Dynamic Fees will increase capital efficiency while maintaining the core value proposition of competitive fees and slippage. It will fulfil our promise of Unified Pools by adding an attractive feature on top of an existing pool. The rollout strategy will follow the approach for Dynamic Fees with an initial Testnet Beta, the release of a comprehensive Whitepaper, and lastly a complete Audit of the Alphix Hook v2.</mark>

{% hint style="info" %}
Our goal is to underpromise and overdeliver. We want to ensure meeting shared deadlines.

#### Long-Term Vision

The DeFi landscape evolves rapidly, making long-term predictions challenging. Our north star is **Unified Pools** - single pools with unified liquidity that deliver best-in-class features for all participants.

We'll achieve this vision through continuous innovation, market-driven insights, and strategic partnerships that push the boundaries of what's possible in decentralised finance.
