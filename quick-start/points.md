# Earn Points

### How Points Work

Points are earned through protocol activity:

* **Swapping** — Earn Points on every swap
* **Providing Liquidity** — Earn Points based on position size and duration
* **Referrals** — Earn bonus Points when referred users are active

### Distribution Schedule

| Detail | Value |
| ------ | ----- |
| Weekly Distribution | 100,000 Points |
| Snapshots | Hourly |
| Season 0 Duration | 3 months |

Points are distributed weekly based on your share of protocol activity. Snapshots are taken hourly to ensure accurate tracking of swaps and LP positions.

### Referral Program

Invite others to Alphix and earn a **10% bonus** on their Points — at no cost to the referred user. Your referral link is available on the Points page once you've connected your wallet.

### Why Points Matter

Points recognize early adopters and active community members. While specific mechanics evolve with each season, consistent participation is rewarded.
