# Earn Points

Alphix rewards early users with Points. Every interaction on the protocol contributes to your total.

### How Points Work

Points are earned through protocol activity:

* **Swapping** — Earn Points on every swap
* **Providing Liquidity** — Earn Points based on position size and duration
* **Referrals** — Earn bonus Points when referred users are active

Points accumulate in **Seasons**. Each season runs for a set period, with distributions happening weekly.

Track your Points and ranking at [alphix.fi/points](https://alphix.fi/points)
{% endhint %}

### Referral Program

Invite others to Alphix and earn a **10% bonus** on their Points. Your referral link is available on the Points page once you've connected your wallet.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Referral bonuses are only available to eligible users.
{% endhint %}

### Why Points Matter

Points recognize early adopters and active community members. While specific mechanics evolve with each season, consistent participation is rewarded.
