# Security

### Pre Audit <a href="#contact" id="contact"></a>

In addition to the many complementary security tools available, we received support from Uniswap, who provided us access to [Olympix](https://olympix.security/) to help strengthen our smart contract analysis.&#x20;

We also leveraged [Sherlock AI](https://sherlock.xyz/solutions/ai) as part of our audit partnership with Sherlock, to catch vulnerabilities early and strengthen protocol safety.

Even after our audits, we continue to leverage all available tools to ensure Alphix remains secure and robust, including built-in fail-safes and monitoring mechanisms.\
