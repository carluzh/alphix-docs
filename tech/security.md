# Security

### Pre Audit <a href="#contact" id="contact"></a>

In addition to the many complementary security tools available, we received support from Uniswap, who provided us access to [Olympix](https://olympix.security/) to help strengthen our smart contract analysis.&#x20;

We also leveraged [Sherlock AI](https://sherlock.xyz/solutions/ai) as part of our audit partnership with Sherlock, to catch vulnerabilities early and strengthen protocol safety.

### Post Audit <a href="#contact" id="contact"></a>

Even after our audits, we continue to leverage all available tools to ensure Alphix remains secure and robust, including built-in fail-safes and monitoring mechanisms.\

If you notice anything unusual or have security concerns, don’t hesitate to [reach out](https://discord.com/invite/NTXRarFbTr).&#x20;

We have partnered with Sherlock to launch a **$30,000** [**bug bounty program**](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/bug-bounties/213) for critical vulnerabilities, reinforcing our commitment to security beyond audits. We invite the security research community to help us keep Alphix safe.
