# Why Alphix

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) markets are evolving toward hook-based architectures (Uniswap V4, Balancer V3, PancakeSwap)**.** However, current implementations offer isolated and non-flexible innovations. As a result, LPs juggle multiple pools, traders suffer increased slippage, and new features face an immediate competitive disadvantage.

**Alphix it** introducing **Unified Pools**<mark style="color:$info;">.</mark>&#x20;

By building a flexible, modular hook layer on top of Uniswap V4, Alphix combines exciting features into a single pool. At the core of this layer sit Dynamic Fees - the first feature, chosen to make Unified Pools immediately competitive by vampiring volume and liquidity.
