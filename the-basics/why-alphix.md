# Why Alphix

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) markets are evolving toward hook-based architectures (Uniswap V4, Balancer V3, PancakeSwap)**.** However, current implementations offer isolated and non-flexible innovations. As a result, LPs juggle multiple pools, traders suffer increased slippage, and new features face an immediate competitive disadvantage.

**Alphix it** introducing **Unified Pools**<mark style="color:$info;">.</mark>

By building a flexible, modular hook layer on top of Uniswap V4, Alphix combines multiple features into a single pool:

*   **Dynamic Fees**

    Swap fees that adjust to market conditions, making pools competitive across volatility regimes.
*   **Unified Yield**

    Idle liquidity is deployed to lending markets, earning additional yield without added management complexities.

Together, these features maximize capital efficiency for LPs while providing traders with competitive execution.

**Our Mission**

* [x] **LPs** earn more from a single and efficient position (per token pair).
* [x] **Traders** get better execution through competitive swap fees and deeper liquidity.
* [x] **Aggregators & Protocols** use Unified Pools to route volume&#x20;
* [x] **Partners** leverage our inherent pool customization to fine-tune markets to their respective demands.
