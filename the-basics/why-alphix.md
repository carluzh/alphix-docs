# Why Alphix

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) markets are evolving toward hook-based architectures (Uniswap V4, Balancer V3, PancakeSwap)**.** However, current implementations offer isolated and non-flexible innovations. As a result, LPs juggle multiple pools, traders suffer increased slippage, and new features face an immediate competitive disadvantage.

**Alphix it** introducing **Unified Pools**<mark style="color:$info;">.</mark>&#x20;

By building a flexible, modular hook layer on top of Uniswap V4, Alphix combines multiple features into a single pool:

* **Dynamic Fees** — Swap fees that adjust to market conditions, making pools competitive across volatility regimes.
* **Unified Yield** — Idle liquidity deployed to Aave, earning yield even when not actively used in swaps.

Together, these features maximize capital efficiency for LPs while offering traders consistently competitive execution.

**Our Mission**

* [x] **LPs** earn more from a single and efficient position (per token pair).
* [x] **Traders** get better execution through competitive swap fees and deeper liquidity.
* [x] **Aggregators&#x20;**<mark style="color:$info;">**& Protocols**</mark> find Alphix pools the obvious first choice for routing volume.
* [x] **Partners** use our customizable pools for their markets, fine-tuning them with our assistance to their respective demands.
